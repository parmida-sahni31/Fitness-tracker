# Fitness-tracker
The fitness tracker calculates the user's bmi, and for specific activities: calories burnt, suggestions for warm up and cool down. 

The program asks the user to input their height and weight and on basis of that, it calculates their bmi.

Next, it provides the user with a list of choices of activities- running, walking, swimmimg, cycling and hiking. The user may choose one or more activities in order to get the output. The user inputs distance covered or steps or time taken to complete the respective activity. 

The program then displays: 
1. The selected activity name.
2. Calories burnt during the activity.
3. Suggessions for warm up and cool down relevant to the activity.
